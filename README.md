The Master module “Quantitative conservation biogeography” is an elective module within the Master programme “Ecology, Evolution and Conservation (EEC)” at the University of Potsdam.

**Module coordinator:** Prof. Dr. Damaris Zurell
**Contributors:** Dr. Guillermo Fandos, Anne-Kathleen Malchow, Dr. Jette Reeg

This site provides the accompanying R practicals for the module. Topics include:


- Occupancy modelling: data preparation, fitting simple occupancy-detection models in unmarked, evaluating occupancy models and making predictions, dynamic occupancy models
- Spatial explicit population modelling: modelling dispersal and demography, assessing reintroduction success and population viability under global change - based on RangeShiftR


Prerequisites for the module are: basic understanding of conservation biogeography (e.g. from accompanying lecture), basic knowledge of statistics, basic knowledge in geographic information systems, basic understanding of R. If you don’t feel comfortable with R yet, you should work through the [R preparatory course](https://damariszurell.github.io/EEC-R-prep/) first.
